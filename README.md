----- Exam questions -----
Building Interactive Business Website of a Real or Virtual, Small or Start-up Company 
A business website for a small or start-up company needs to showcase the brand, the products or the
services, while attracting potential customers, by balancing professionalism, usability, and interactivity.
Objectives
Building the website would enable you to demonstrate the knowledge and skills, acquired during the
elective course of Web Development, as well as your creativity and understanding of modern dynamic
web functionality.
It should provide useful and usable information to potential readers, presented by a clean, responsive
user-oriented design, which enables basic interactivity and accessibility, created by use of HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, or optionally Python.

----- Requirements -----
Web Design

Analyse the business domain area and the profile of the potential website users
-> design web content, structure, and interactions of the user with the website
-> you can use a design thinking approach and usability criteria for building a prototype
-> show the prototype for evaluation by a potential human user and update it to reflect on the
eventual external recommendations



HTML requirements

Home: a brief introduction of the company – brand identity, mission, vision, and core values
-> About: key team members and roles, history, certifications, awards, partners and testimonials
-> Catalogue of Products or Services: a visual gallery or list of projects with links to details.
-> Latest: news, campaigns, case studies, or blog with articles

-> Implement appropriate layout styles for responsive design, so the website looks good on both
mobile and desktop screens.
-> Consider fulfilling accessibility requirements.
-> Test the styles against responsibility, usability, and accessibility

Programming Interactivity
-> Implement two or more interactive features, such as:
-> collecting and processing data from the user
-> filtering items by category
-> switching colours between light and dark themes
-> filling in and validation forms
-> API calls
-> animations, various menu types, or similar
-> Add basic JavaScript and/or Python for processing the user input and some basic operating with
the data
-> Validate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code using online services
-> Deploy the final product on localhost or remote web server of your choice
Project Documentation
-> Prepare and provide a README file explaining the
-> analysis of usage scenarios and definition of requirements
-> design approach and the product structure,
-> process of implementation, testing, validation, and prototyping,
-> technologies used for development and deployment,
-> any challenges or features implemented beyond the requirements.
-> Include clear instructions on how to reproduce the project solution, if relevant.

Your project solution will be assessed by various criteria, such as
-> Proper design process
-> Clean and simplified web structure
-> Proper use of HTML semantic tags
-> Media and visualisation features
-> Use of typography and colours
-> Consistent and appealing styling
-> Responsive design
-> Accessibility considerations

You may also consider the best practices known from small business websites, such as:
-> Simplicity: The design is clean and straightforward to navigate, with no unnecessary
complexity that might confuse users.
-> Brand Consistency: All pages are cohesive in terms of style and content, in order to reinforce
brand identity.
-> Call-to-Actions (CTAs): Clear, well-placed CTAs throughout the site to encourage user
engagement (e.g., “Book a consultation”, “Get mail”, “Get started,” etc.).
-> Trust Elements: Incorporated trust signals like customer testimonials, social proof, secure
authentication, and clear privacy policies.
By applying your knowledge and skills, and following quality criteria and recommendations from the
practice, you can create a website that looks professional, enhances user engagement, and effectively
communicates its offerings – a significant contribution to success.
